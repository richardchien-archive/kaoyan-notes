Dear Sir or Madam,

Project Hope as a noble cause moved me, and the achivement so far encouraged me to devote into charity. To contribute my bit, I would like to offer financial aid to a kid in a remote rural area in your province.

I would appreciate a lot if you could help me find a girl who has just started schooling but whose family cannot afford the education fee. What I could offer is to pay for her education annually, until she graduates from middle school. It would be best if I could directly remit my donation to the bank account of her family.

I really hope to do my small part to help improve lives in poor countryside. My thanks for your generous help are beyond words.

Yours truly,

Li Ming

Dear Richard,

I've arrived home yesterday evening, meaning my American trip finished successfully. My thanks for your kindly reception is beyond expression.

Retrospecting the days in California, I'm expressed by many of its places, especially the Golden Gate Bridge of which the magnitude is beyond my imagination. Thank you for also taking me to visit the Apple Park in Palo Alto, which is the most beautiful office building I've ever seen. Besides the places of interest, the food is delicous and the people are warm-hearted too.

China has plenty of historical and natural sites as well, such as the Great Wall and the West Lake. I'm quite willing to take you around if you come to China.

Let me express my appreciation to you again for giving me a nice experience in the USA.

Yours,
Zhang Wei

Dear Sir or Madam,

Finding something wrong with the electronic dictionary that I bought from your store yesterday, I am writing this letter to you to seek for a proper solution.

The problem of the e-dictionary is that, when I hit the "Enter" button, it does not work as intended. Particulaly, in the "Search" view, it does not trigger the searching action.

It is in effect totally preventing me from using the dictionary, so that I would like to ask you for a prompt solution. Is it possible to return and refund or replace it with a new one?

I would appreciate it a lot if you could help deal with the issue, and I am looking forward to your reply soon.

Yours sincerely,

Zhang Wei

Dear Prof. Cook,

At the very beginning, I would like to extend my heartfelt welcome to you. It's my pleasure to offer you some suggestions on tourist attractions in the city of Nanjing.

First of all, Fuzimiao (or literally Confucian Temple) is the most recommended place of interest in this city, where you will be impressed by the excellent landscape of Qinhuai River and attracted by delicious traditional food. Another nice place to go is Zijin Mountain, mostly because it's beautiful mountainview.

Provided that you would like to visit any tourist site here, I am always willing to be your guide. Hope you could enjoy your life here in Nanjing.

Yours sincerely,

Li Ming
