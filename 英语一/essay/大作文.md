Love

As is vividly shown in the picture, a candle is lit up in a bowl on the ground. Different from any other candle we commonly see, the spark of this one is like a smiling face, indicating love and happiness. The caption above the candle reads, "Love is a light, the darker it faces, the brighter it shines".

What the picture tries to convey to us is that, no matter how tough the hardship is, it would be possible for us to overcome it so long as we hold a belief of love. Take the Wenchuan earthquake in 2008 for example, enormously disastrous as it was, the once-in-a-century earthquake destroyed tens of thousands of buildings, roads, public facilities, and, most regretfully, homes. While the disaster was strong, the love of people from all around the country and even the world was stronger. Thanks to the donations, medical aids, material supplies, and more importantly, the belief and love of themselves, the local people finally recovered from the earthquake and returned to normal life.

To me, love is not only an abstract concept we are always talking about, but also something that we must take into action. Donating old clothes, helping senior citizens across the road, and so on—these are all the little things that can generate great help. The key is whether we do them or not.

Cultures—National and International

As is shown above, in the center of the picture stands a lovely American girl, smiling. If we dig into the details, we will find that the most special part is that she is wearing a traditional Chinese costume, which indicates the trend of international cultural exchange nowadays.

In the modern world, with the rise of the Internet, people from all around the world are connected closer than it was a dozen years ago. Since we can now chat with an American or a European without almost any latency, cultural exchange has been profoundly enhanced. Besides what the photo above shows, there are many other similar cases of this phenomenon, for instance, traditional programs of Malaysia are being performed in China, and Chinese orchestras are playing songs that originate from ancient Britain.

In my view, on the one hand, it should be encouraged that people from different countries share their cultural heritage with each other, making the national international. On the other hand, while facing alien cultures, it's important for us to determine whether they are positive or negative, and take in the good ones and dismiss the bad ones.

Flowers in Greenhouses

It is vividly depicted in the drawings that a flower used to live in greenhouse cannot go through the storms outside. In the first picture, with rains pouring and lightning flashing, the flower—under the protection of the greenhouse—grows healthily, seeming to be able to overcome any hardships. While in the second picture, without the shelter, the flower fades quickly, showing it's fragile nature.

What the two pictures try to indicate is that people who are spoiled by comfortable environments may be unable to succeed while facing challenges. Take many of the youth born in the late 1990s and early 2000s for example, being the only child of their families, most of them are excessively spoiled by their parents. Those who are over-protected often feel difficult to live their own lives in the real world without others' help, which is definitely not a good phenomenon.

To me, I deem the ability that one can live on one's own as a basic requirement for any youngsters in the 21st century. Specifically, we should be brave and thoughtful while making decisions, and take the responsibilities that come along with the rights. Only when all of our young people are strong can our nation become strong.

Never Stop Struggling

As is vividly displayed above, in the center of the drawing is a passionate man running on the track, with a smile on his face. From the indicators on the ground we can learn that he is making the final sprint toward the finishing line, which, at the same time, also represents a new start point.

Thought-provoking meaning that the picture conveys is that, we should never stop challenging ourselves. As the well-known saying goes, "Cease to struggle and you cease to live." Whenever we achieved success—be it great or small—we shouldn't be satisfied. On the contrary, it is of great importance for us to keep on going, for a greater achievement.

Take us college students for example, going to graduate from university in several months, we are still far from getting rid of struggling, in that in front of us stands a brand-new challenge, the society, which is much tougher to deal with than what we've seen before. Therefore, what we should do is to prepare ourselves for the upcoming new stage, instead of to merely cheer up for the long-awaited graduation from school.

## 2005

It is vividly depicted in the drawing that, three men and a woman are playing a "football game". With the "football", their senior father, in the middle of the playground, the four children who are in their primes are guarding their goals to prevent their father from getting in. Under the picture is a caption that reads, "a football match on taking care of old parents".

The symbolic meaning of the cartoon seems apparent, but on the other hand, it's thought-provoking. Since several years ago, from TV news, the Internet, or any other media, we may have learned or witnessed a considerable amount of such cases that some people refuse to take the responsibility of supporting their elderly parents' lives, which is definitely not a desirable phenomenon. Actions are needed to reverse the unhealthy trend.

In my view, it's imperative for us and our government to do the following two things to deal with the phenomenon in question. For one thing, effective regulations should be established to ensure punishment for the behavior of shrugging off the legal liability. For another, we should do whatever helpful to protect the hundreds of thousands of elderly that are not properly taken care of. Only by taking practical actions instead of merely talking can we make the world a better place for senior citizens to live.
